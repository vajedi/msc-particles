We would like to express our gratitude to our supervisor Bengt E.W. Nilsson, for guidance and for introducing us to the 
fascinating world of M-theory. A special thanks for never losing your patience although, at times, it seemed 
like the work with this thesis could go on forever. The authors would also like to thank each other for good work and 
cooperation and for the complete understanding of the importance of breaks.

In this thesis we outline U-duality covariant dynamics for a $D_1$-brane in 9-dimensional supergravity and for a 
$D_2$-brane in 8-dimensional supergravity. By introducing modified field strengths, all world-volume fields couple 
to the background fields in a manifestly U-duality symmetric way. Our methods produce an action involving a function 
$\Phi$ which can only be deduced by demanding it to fulfill certain duality relations. This is achieved (to some extent) 
by implementing the equations in a computer program. Furthermore, solving the field equations for some of the potentials 
produces integration parameters which can be identified as the brane charges.
The thesis also contains an introduction to supergravity, Kaluza-Klein reduction and U-duality, as well as the complete 
construction of bosonic 9-, 8- and 7-dimensional supergravity.
